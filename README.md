# Jays Life

Jays Life is a personal web application built with Node.js and Express. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a modern, minimalist personal website that includes a contact form with integration to MailGun for sending emails.

This project was created to demonstrate the use of Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and other modern web development technologies to build a responsive and functional personal website. The contact form is designed to allow users to easily send messages, which are then handled by the MailGun service for email delivery.

Features of the project include:
- A clean and responsive design
- A contact form with client-side validation and AJAX submission
- Integration with MailGun for email sending
